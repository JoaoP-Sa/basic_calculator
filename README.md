This is a basic calculator that i created using html, css and javascript. This was my first "project" using javascript, i did it because i wanted really learn how works programming logic, and i was having some difficulty to learn it, and this project helped me a lot to understand it and i decided to write everything in english (with exception of html title) to practice my english too haha. So hope you enjoy this project, and thanks to see it.
